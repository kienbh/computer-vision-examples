# 🖼️ Computer Vision Lab Examples: CSE3062-BCSE2022


This repository contains practical examples and lab exercises for the **Computer Vision** course (12 weeks, 4h/week).  
The goal is to help students build solid foundations in **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** and gain hands-on experience with **Deep Learning for Computer Vision**.  

Students will gradually learn how to:
1. Understand the principles of **digital imaging** (sampling, quantization, resolution).
2. Implement core **image processing algorithms** using OpenCV.
3. Explore **CNNs & YOLO** for object detection.
4. Experiment with **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**.
5. Complete a **final project**: build and deploy a computer vision solution (API/App).
